# Prompting

Prompting is a technique used with OpenAI's language models to guide the generation of text by providing an initial context or instruction. By providing a prompt, you can influence the output of the model and make it more specific to your desired task or scenario.

The prompt typically consists of a short piece of text that sets the context or asks a question, followed by a continuation or completion prompt that indicates where the model should continue generating text.

Let's take an example to illustrate how prompting works:

```python
import langchain

# Set your OpenAI API key
langchain.set_api_key('YOUR_API_KEY')

# Initialize a completion instance
completion = langchain.Completion()

# Set the model configuration
completion.set_model("text-davinci-003")

# Set the prompt text
prompt = "Translate the following English text to French:"

# Set the continuation prompt
continuation = "Hello, how are you?"

# Combine prompt and continuation
input_text = prompt + " " + continuation

# Generate text
response = completion.complete(input_text)

# Get the generated translation from the response
generated_translation = response['choices'][0]['text']

# Print the generated translation
print(generated_translation)
```

In this example, we use prompting to instruct the model to translate a specific English text to French. The prompt "Translate the following English text to French:" sets the context, and the continuation prompt "Hello, how are you?" serves as the input text for translation.

By providing the prompt and continuation, we guide the model to focus on the task of translation. The model generates the translated text, and we extract it from the API response.

Prompting can be used for various tasks such as text generation, summarization, translation, and more. It allows you to control and shape the output of the language model according to your specific requirements.

It's important to experiment with different prompts and continuations to achieve the desired results. You can iterate and refine your prompts to optimize the output based on the specific use case or task you're working on.
